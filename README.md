# Crypto Trade Tracker

A personal web application to track my cryptocurrency trades over time.  
This is a full-stack project built with:

- React (frontend)
- Express + Node.js (backend)
- JavaScript throughout
- JSON file for storage (for now)

The app helps me log every crypto operation I do — buy or sell — and keep track of amounts, fees, asset types, and time. I can also edit or delete trades in case of mistakes.
